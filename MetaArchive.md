### Summary: 
The mission of the MetaArchive Cooperative is to foster better understanding of distributed digital preservation methods and to create enduring and stable, geographically dispersed “dark archives” of digital materials that can be drawn upon to restore collections at member organisations.

### Format types: 
Not specified.
### Third-party content support: 
Not specified.

### Features: 
Member institutions prepare their content for preservation, producing packages of content according to their local needs and workflows using tools such as Islandora, Archivematica, BitCurator, Fedora or Hydra. MetaArchive has produced a set of tools and scripts to assist members in preparing content for ingest into the preservation network, including tools to help with BagIt based ingests, and validating the quality of files before ingesting. All tools are publicly available.

### Costs: 
Membership starts at $2,500 with additional fees for cache hosting, technology and storage.

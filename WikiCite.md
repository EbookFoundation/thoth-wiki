[WikiCite](http://wikicite.org/) is a Wikimedia initiative to develop open citations and linked bibliographic data to serve free knowledge based on [[Wikidata]]. 

Several tools and strategies exist to make WikiCite happen. The goals of WikiCite include improvement of citations in Wikimedia projects and an open, collaborative repository of bibliographic data for innovative applications.

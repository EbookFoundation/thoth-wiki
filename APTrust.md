### Summary:
The Academic Preservation Trust (APTrust) is a consortium of higher education institutions committed to providing both a preservation repository for digital content and collaboratively developed services related to that content. The APTrust repository accepts digital materials in all formats from member institutions, and provides redundant storage in the cloud. It is managed and operated by the University of Virginia.

### Format types:
All types of digital content from its member institutions, including but not limited to print, audio, video, and encrypted files

### Third-party content support:

### Features:
The Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform provides APTrust with unlimited capacity that usually generates costs only as it is needed or used. A portion of the APTrust annual membership dues covers preservation of the first 10 terabytes of content per member, and members may purchase additional capacity in increments of 1 terabyte at a current cost of $420 per year. Those core service costs provide for three preservation copies of content in separate S3 availability zones in the AWS datacentre in Virginia and three preservation copies of content in separate Glacier availability zones in AWSâ€™s Oregon datacentre. APTrust conducts fixity checks on deposited content every three months. Long history of success and a very active community; good documentation and best practice.

### Costs:
Membership dues are $20,000 per year.

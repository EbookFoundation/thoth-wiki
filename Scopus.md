[Scopus](https://www.scopus.com), owned by RELX/Reed Elsevier, is an abstract and citation database. Scopus has a [title suggestion interface](https://suggestor.step.scopus.com/suggestTitle/step1.cfm) for the upload of single books and metadata through a custom form.

## Scopus content policy

Scopus content policy as regards book publication is outlined [here](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/scopus/how-scopus-works/content/content-policy-and-selection):

> Scopus covers scholarly books that represent fully-referenced, original research or literature reviews.

* Subject areas: Focus on Social sciences and Arts & Humanities (A&H), but also Science, Technology & Medicine (STM)
* Book types: Monographs, edited volumes, major reference works, graduate level text books
* NOT in scope: Dissertations, undergraduate-level text books, Atlas, Yearbook, Biography, Popular science books, manuals, etc.

> Book selection is via a publisher-based approach (no individual book suggestions are considered). As the selection is evaluated on a per publisher basis, the Content Selection and Advisory Board (CSAB) is not involved in the evaluation of this content type. A dedicated group of highly educated individuals are responsible for the publisher selection process. For those selected publishers, all books deemed "in scope " will be covered.

> Publishers can suggest their books for Scopus coverage via the Scopus Books Suggestion form. Books will only be considered for evaluation if they meet the following minimum criteria:

* All books must contain ISBNs.
* All books must be available in digital format (PDF or xml).
* All metadata must be captured in ONIX or MARC.
* All metadata must contain BIC or BISAC subject area codes.
* All book content must be in the English language.
* Book types in scope are: Monographs, edited volumes, major reference works, and graduate level text books.

> Those book lists from publishers that meet the minimum criteria will be reviewed according to the following selection criteria:

* Reputation and impact of the publisher
* Size and subject area of the books list (subject area(s) Arts & Humanities and/or Social Sciences are preferred).
* Availability and format of the book content
* Publication policy and editorial mission
* Quality of published book content

> A dedicated team will manually review all suggested books one time per year, during the summer. All suggested books will be evaluated based upon the above described selection criteria. Scopus will contact books publisher with the outcome of the books evaluation.

## Necessary metadata fields

> Our workflow is indeed designed at the front end to handle uploads in batch formats in an automated manner for the certified publishers (content providers). The critical XML fields that need to be extracted automatically are:

* BIC or BISAC
* Book level description 
* Book type
* Book Audience
* All available ISBNâ€™s
* All available DOIs

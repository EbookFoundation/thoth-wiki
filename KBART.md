KBART is a NISO Recommended Practice. A definition of the KBART format is provided in NISO's ["Knowledge Bases and Related Tools (KBART) Recommended Practice" (NISO RP-9-2014)](https://www.niso.org/publications/rp/rp-9-2014/).

It is recommended that COPIM/Thoth seek [KBART Endorsement](https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/kbart/kbart-endorsement) with NISO, and is listed in the [KBART Registry](https://sites.google.com/site/kbartregistry/) before making this feature public.

The [EBSCO Integrated Knowledge Base](https://www.ebsco.com/publisher-support/knowledge-base) serves as the foundation of the discovery solution ensuring the data about your e-journals, eBooks and collections are shared among multiple products such as Full Text Finder (EBSCOâ€™s A-to-Z listing service and Link Resolver), Usage Consolidation, ERM-E and our Holdings Management tool. To ensure EBSCO has the most up-to-date information, please send title list information on a regular basis.

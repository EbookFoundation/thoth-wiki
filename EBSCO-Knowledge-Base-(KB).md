[Issue 49](https://github.com/thoth-pub/thoth/issues/49) Issue closed. Standard Thoth KBART output accepted by EBSCO KnowledgeBase.

The [EBSCO Integrated Knowledge Base](https://www.ebsco.com/publisher-support/knowledge-base) serves as the foundation of the discovery solution ensuring the data about your e-journals, eBooks and collections are shared among multiple products such as Full Text Finder (EBSCO’s A-to-Z listing service and Link Resolver), Usage Consolidation, ERM-E and our Holdings Management tool. To ensure EBSCO has the most up-to-date information, please send title list information on a regular basis.

* Metadata format: [[KBART]], [[XLSX]], [[CSV]], [[MARC]], [[XML]] 

EBSCO has multiple platforms, each with its own submission process. So, for example, GOBI, which takes only printed works, requests that publishers send new titles in both hardback and paperback for which they create their own metadata that will later be distributed to their library network. (actually these - and all printed orders received - are sent to an agent based in UK who on ships them to the US - even though we have US printers so could ship directly from there!)  

Another platform, EBSCOHost, provides publishers with a metadata template in .xlsx format, but the template does not request nor allow the input of information regarding the type of access or copyright / license of the titles.  For publishers that can provide ebook metadata in ONIX 2.1, they do allow the input of information related to the license under which a work is published on the ‘Audience Restriction’ field. 

Similarly EBSCO KB, a service used by libraries to manage collections and help with content discoverability, allows the input of metadata in KBART that includes title, ISBN, URL, Author(s), Publisher, DOI, Edition / Volume Number and access type of the e-books, but not of metadata information related to the copyright / license of the title as a whole. This ultimately makes it difficult for publishers to flag content as Open Access.

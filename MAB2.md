Metadata format used in Germany
Seems it is nearing end-of-life with regards to further development, as the national library has started a project to adapt to MARC21, but as it seems, it is still widely used in Germany, Austria and Switzerland (according to BÃ¼lte). Wikidata has specs: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1906834
and https://web.archive.org/web/20181121033620/https://www.dnb.de/DE/Standardisierung/Formate/MAB/mab_node.html

But still, might be a dead end as catalogs already support MARC21, so maybe rather a historical note of sorts
(although there's a mention of hbz (a regional library centre) converting DOAB data from MARC to MAB... so still in use)

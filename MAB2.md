Metadata format used in German-speaking countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland).

Seems it is nearing end-of-life with regards to further development, as the national library has started a project to adapt to MARC21, but according to [BÃ¼lte, in Graf, D., Fadeeva, Y., Falkenstein-Feldhoff, K. (Eds.), 2020](https://doi.org/10.17185/duepublico/72237), it is still widely used in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

But still, might be a dead end as catalogs already support MARC21, so maybe rather a historical note of sorts
(although there's a mention of hbz (a regional library centre) converting DOAB data from MARC to MAB... so appears to still be in use)

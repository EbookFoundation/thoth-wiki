### Summary: 
Maintained at GESIS – Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, SSOAR collects and archives literature of relevance to the social sciences and makes it available open access in accordance with the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities.

### Format types: 
Only PDF – ideally PDF/A – files – are archived.

### Third-party content support:

### Preservation: 
The databases are automatically saved every three hours. Incremental backups of the system are carried out on a daily basis and a complete backup is performed once a week. The data are backed up on internal GESIS data storage media, thereby ensuring the separation of server and backup. Security updates are carried out automatically and in a timely manner. If the system should fail, it can be reconstructed within a day with the standard software after the backed-up data has been imported.

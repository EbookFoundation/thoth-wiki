> Metadata Batch Import: MERLOT supports batch processes for those who wish to contribute 100+ materials to our collection. This process allows you to bypass the MERLOT Contribute form to easily add large amounts of metadata about many learning materials into the MERLOT collection. MERLOT provides a spreadsheet template into which you enter all the metadata fields that correspond, in the exact format specified, to the required metadata in the MERLOT collection. MERLOT staff, working with your staff, verifies the data and imports the completed spreadsheet data into the MERLOT collection. For more detailed information about the process and to obtain the spreadsheet, contact the MERLOT Webmaster at webmaster@merlot.org.

MARC21 is the main metadata record file format used within institutional libraries. It is partially compatible with [[MARCXML]]. MARC21 ought to be phased out, but considering the enormous amounts of often idiosyncratic records in every single library this seems unlikely in the future.

[MARC21 specifications](https://www.loc.gov/marc/) are maintained by the Library of Congress.

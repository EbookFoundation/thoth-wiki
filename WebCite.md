### Summary: 
An on-demand archiving system for web references (cited webpages and websites, or other kinds of Internet-accessible digital objects). No longer accepts new archiving requests but continues to serve existing archives as of July 2019.

### Format types: 
All types of web content, including HTML web pages, PDF files, style sheets, JavaScript and digital images can be preserved.

### Third-party content support: 
As above.

### Features: 
It is not crawler-based; pages are only archived if the citing author or publisher requests it. No cached copy will appear in a WebCite search unless the author or another person has specifically cached it beforehand.

### Costs: 
No charge to individual users or publishers to use the service, but publishers who want their publications analysed and cited references archived must pay a fee.

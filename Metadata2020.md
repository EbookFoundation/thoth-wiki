[Metadata2020](https://metadata2020.org/learn-more/) is an initiative "to advocate for richer, connected and reusable metadata for all outputs because":

* Richer metadata fuels discoverability and innovation
* Connected metadata bridges the gaps between systems and communities
* Reusable metadata eliminates duplication of effort

Metadata2020 has not provided any guidelines yet but Thoth/ScholarLed could sign the pledge as our project fully falls into the purview of Metadata2020 goals.

Metadata2020 also has a list of [best practices](https://metadata2020.org/resources/metadata-best-practices/).

[ScienceOpen](https://www.scienceopen.com/) is a discovery platform for scholarly research. Its database is openly accessible to users. While initially focusing on OA journal articles, ScienceOpen has been expanding its reach to include OA books, which now amounts to >3 million book and chapter records aggregated.

As of 2021-04, a dedicated project funded by Germany's Federal Ministry of Education and Research is seeking to more formally place OA books/monographs within the scope of ScienceOpen, with a corresponding plan to develop an advanced metadata standard.

> Unfortunately, due to the recent Florida state budget cuts state funds are no longer available to support services and resources previously provided by the Orange Grove. The Orange Grove platform and website have been permanently shut down. Some of the resources contained in the Orange Grove may be available through other repositories such as MERLOT or OER Commons. Thank you for your commitment to open educational resources and making education more affordable!

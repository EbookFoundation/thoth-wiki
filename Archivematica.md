**Summary:** Archivematica is an integrated suite of open-source software tools that allows users to process digital objects from ingest to access in compliance with the ISO-OAIS functional model. Users monitor and control ingest and preservation micro-services via a web-based dashboard.

**Format types:** Maintains the original format of all ingested files to support migration and emulation strategies. Normalises files to preservation and access formats upon ingest. Groups file formats into format policies (e.g. text, audio, video, raster image, vector image, etc.). Archivematicaâ€™s preservation formats must all be open standards.

**Third-party content support:** Not specified.

**Features:** Archivematica uses METS, PREMIS, Dublin Core, the Library of Congress BagIt specification and other recognised standards to generate Archival Information Packages (AIPs) for storage in a preferred repository. Good format compatibility and integration with third party systems to allow for easy moving between systems as needed. Good documentation.

**Costs:** Open source with additional costs for support and hosting.

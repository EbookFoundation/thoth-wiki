The [ResearchGraph](https://researchgraph.org/) network links research objects (publications, dataset, researcher profiles and grants) from Research Infrastructures (such as ORCID, DataCite, Crossref, Research Data Australia), Open Access Repositories (such as Dryad, figshare, NCI), and Funders including National Institutes of Health (NIH), Australian Research Council (ARC), and more.

It makes use of an [Augment API](https://researchgraph.org/augment-api/) and a [ResearchGraph schema](https://researchgraph.org/schema/).

The [Digital Public Library of America](https://dp.la/search) (DPLA) is a Discovery platform to make millions of materials from libraries, archives, museums, and other cultural institutions across the country publicly available.

Next to that, the DPLA provides a library-controlled marketplace and platform - [[SimplyE]] - for libraries to purchase, organize, and deliver ebooks and other e-content to their patrons.

### Third-party content support: 
When a dynamic page contains forms, JavaScript, or other elements that require interaction with the originating host, the archive will not contain the original siteâ€™s functionality.

### Features: 
Crawls are contributed from various sources, some imported from third parties and others generated internally by the Archive. The frequency of snapshot captures varies per website. Datacentres in three Californian cities: San Francisco, Redwood City, and Richmond. To prevent losing the data in case of e.g. a natural disaster, the Archive attempts to create copies of (parts of) the collection at more distant locations, currently including the Bibliotheca Alexandrina in Egypt and a facility in Amsterdam.

"The goal of Inciteful is to give the world free tools to help accelerate academic research. If that means getting up to speed on a new topic, finding the latest literature, or figuring out how two ideas are connected, we can help. Unlike a traditional search engine, citations are the cornerstone of all of our tools."
"Being built off the backs of free and open data, we commit to paying it forward by keeping our own tools free for everyone."


Pulls data from several databases, including [[CrossRef]] and [[Semantic Scholar]]

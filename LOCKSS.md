### Summary: 
The Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe (LOCKSS) programme one of the longest-running digital preservation initiatives still operating today. Provides the foundation for robust digital preservation of all types of digital content for libraries, publishers, and other content providers and stewards. The Global LOCKSS Network provides post-cancellation and perpetual access for eligible web-harvestable open access and subscription publications to participating libraries. See also [[CLOCKSS]].

### Format types: 
Supports a range of formats. [[WARC]] as default for back-end storage abstraction.

### Third-party content support: 
Uses plug-ins to automatically ingest content, so does not specifically pull out or identify third-party content.

### Features: 
LOCKSS networks can use a variety of mechanisms to ingest content. Currently, these methods are part of workflows that make content available for retrieval over the web. The LOCKSS software currently expects to be able to retrieve content for ingest over HTTP, in keeping with the original use case of harvesting web-based scholarly publications. However, any digital content can just as well be ingested and preserved, provided it can be made accessible over HTTP. There is a growing library of plugins for parsing the content and metadata made available by a variety of source platforms, according to a variety of packaging standards. As LOCKSS systems are managed locally, they do not trigger global OA release.

### Costs: 
The LOCKSS software and technical documentation are available at no cost and under open licenses. Participation fees for the LOCKSS Alliance sustain ongoing improvement of core LOCKSS technologies and provide for technical support by the LOCKSS Program. Costs start at $2,642 depending on Carnegie classification.

[Wikisource](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Help:Introduction) provides a free, wiki-based library that invites volunteer contributors to collect, organize, proofread, illustrate and annotate English-language source texts, with Wikisources for other languages also available. 

> Wikisource, the free library, is a Wikimedia Foundation project and a sister site of Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Like Wikipedia, Wikisource is a project that anyone can edit and is subject to the same terms of use. Primary sources found at Wikisource can often be used in conjunction with Wikipedia's encyclopedia articles for effective research.

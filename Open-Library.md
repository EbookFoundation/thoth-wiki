[Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/) is a digital library project by the Internet Archive, providing access to a large variet of books through its [Open Library Explorer](https://openlibrary.org/explore) portal.

The portal provides an openly-available RESTful API, best used to link into Open Library data in JSON, YAML and RDF/XML. Open Library also encourages the use of established bibliographic standards including MARC21, UniMARC & ONIX. Catalog record dumps are available in JSON format.

ARC is a lossless data compression and archival format by System Enhancement Associates (SEA). The file format and the program were both called ARC. 

The .arc filename extension is often used for several unrelated file archive-like file types. For example, the Internet Archive used its own ARC format to store multiple web resources into a single file.[1][2] The FreeArc archiver also uses .arc extension, but uses a completely different file format.

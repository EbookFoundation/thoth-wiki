Scalar is a free, open source authoring and publishing platform thatâ€™s designed to make it easy for authors to write long-form, born-digital scholarship online. Scalar enables users to assemble media from multiple sources and juxtapose them with their own writing in a variety of ways, with minimal technical expertise required.

Scalar is a semantic web authoring tool that brings a considered balance between standardization and structural flexibility to all kinds of material. It includes a built-in reading interface as well as an API that enables Scalar content to be used to drive custom-designed applications.

Scalar is a project of the Alliance for Networking Visual Culture ([AVNC](https://scalar.me/anvc/about/)) in association with [Vectors](https://www.vectorsjournal.org/) and [IML](http://iml.usc.edu/), and with the support of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

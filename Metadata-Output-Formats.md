### CreDiT

> The CreDiT taxonomy provides a way to encode contribution information inside article XML files. The taxonomy identifies the specific nature of an individualâ€™s contribution with respect to the research material at hand. The purpose of CRediT is to provide transparency in contributions to scholarly published work, to enable improved systems of attribution, credit, and accountability.

[CreDiT Taxonomy Guidelines](https://jats4r.org/credit-taxonomy) have been published by Jats 4 Reuse.

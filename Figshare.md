[Figshare](https://figshare.com/) is a paid service underpinning many institutional repositories.

It has a well-documented [public API](https://docs.figshare.com/) which account holders can use to interact with their repository (as an alternative to the GUI). This facilitates the automation of archiving and preservation tasks, such as uploading content files and adding metadata.

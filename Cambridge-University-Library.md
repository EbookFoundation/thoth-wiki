### Summary: 
CUL is committed to collecting and caring for digital content to support the goals and vision of CUL, and the mission and core values of the University of Cambridge.

### Format types: 
CUL accepts any type of digital content, regardless format, quality, carrier or rights. CUL prefers and selects the highest quality of digital content available, with a preference for open rather than proprietary file formats.

### Third-party content support: 
CUL hosts and makes available third-party digital content.

### Preservation: 
Minimum preservation activities ensure that preservation master, co-master and born-digital original digital content, associated materials, associated metadata and fixity information for each file are retained. Preservation master, co-master, born-digital original, associated materials and associated metadata are stored in no less than three geographically separate locations and utilise a diversity of storage media. Recovery of all preservation master, co-master, born digital original, associated materials and associated metadata is possible from all locations and storage media, and is successfully tested on an annual basis.

Extendable Markup Language (XML) is a markup language designed for both [[human-readable]] and [[machine-readable]] documents. XML is defined as a syntax, without fixed vocabulary. The currently widely used version of XML is [XML 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/) as defined by the W3C. XML is also used as syntax for [[ONIX 3.0]] and [[MARCXML]] metadata records.

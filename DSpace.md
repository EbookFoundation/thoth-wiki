[DSpace](https://dspace.lyrasis.org/) is an [open-source](https://github.com/DSpace) repository system. It allows programmatic access via both its own API and the [[SWORD]] protocol.

There are no official client libraries for the DSpace REST API (v7+), but one of the DSpace developers has begun developing a [Python client library](https://pypi.org/project/dspace-rest-client/).

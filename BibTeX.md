BibTeX is the metadata format used in [LaTeX](https://www.ctan.org/) typesetting environments, which is particularly popular in the STEM disciplines. A basic definition of the format is found on the [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/Format/) website. More information of the specific formatting of BibTeX metadata files can be found in the documentation of the [BibTeX package](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/bibtex). A short guide is available [here](https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/osborne/latex/BIBTEX.HTM).

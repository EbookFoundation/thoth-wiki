Metadata are data about data. In the context of scholcomm, metadata are usually descriptive metadata, describing the essential features of an object. 

In recent years, the boundary between data and metadata have become progressively blurred, as data such as references have become included in metadata schemes. The distinction between data and metadata only makes sense as long as the data encoded in an [[object]] is (partially) [[human-readable]]. In a fully [[machine-readable]] object, the encoding and distinction between data and metadata essentially disappears.

### Summary: 
A community-supported preservation archive that safeguards access to e-journals, e-books, and digital collections. 

### Format types: 
Most often, books are sent as batches of XML with one or more PDFs, figure graphics, and supplementary files. Some publishers supply EPUB. No formal limit to supported filetypes. See [Hanson, 2019](https://www.dpconline.org/blog/enhancing-services-to-preserve-new-forms-of-scholarship) for an overview.

### Third-party content support: 
Mostly expect that the publisher will package everything and send it to them. Occasionally have received other material such as lists of links and dealt with this on an individual basis. Risk-averse in terms of copyright.

### Features: 
Can download from interface, validate and migrate file formats, perform fixity checks. Current approach works very well for content that looks similar to the print world; Portico are also exploring solutions for more dynamic content and reference databases where access is networked rather than hierarchical, with a particular focus on what can scale. 

### Costs: 
Tiered model based on revenue, starting at $1,000. Additional one-off set-up fee.

### Summary: 
The aim of the Archaeology Data Service (ADS) is to collect, describe, catalogue, preserve, and provide user support for digital resources that are created as a product of archaeological research. The ADS also has a responsibility for promoting standards and guidelines for best practice in the creation, description, preservation and use of archaeological information.

### Format types: 
Preferred file formats are open stable formats suitable for preservation (may be converted to a more accessible web format for dissemination). A list can be found here: archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/advice/Downloads.xhtml. 

### Third-party content support: 
Many different media types are supported for direct upload.

### Preservation: 
The ADS maintain multiple copies of data in order to facilitate disaster recovery and provide resilience. The University of York provides short and medium-term storage of all datasets held by the repository. All data is stored on a pair of Dell Compellent enterprise storage arrays (current capacity ~1Pb), located in two different data centres. The UoY ITS use Linear Tape-Open (LTO-6) for 90-day backups. UoY ITS plan to continue to migrate to newer LTO versions (with greater durability and storage capacity) as a matter of course; migrating to newer LTO versions will help to ensure against media deterioration. The ADS has implemented cloud-based storage via Amazon Web Services (AWS) for long-term/deep storage of the off-site backup only.

### Costs: Charges are made on a per-file basis.

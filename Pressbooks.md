[Pressbooks](https://pressbooks.org/) is a book content management system which allows people to publish webbooks and produce exports in a variety of formats, including EPUB, accessible [PDF](https://docraptor.com/blog/docraptor-vs-princexml/), print-ready PDF, and various XML flavours.

[Pressbooks](https://pressbooks.org/) is built on top of [WordPress Multisite](https://wordpress.org/support/article/glossary/#multisite), and makes significant changes to:

*    admin interface (customized for books and other structured documents, like magazines, journals, reports, etc.);
*    web presentation layer (again, customized for books and structured documents); and
*    export routines.

Pressbooks is free software, released under the [GPL v3.0 or later](https://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/blob/master/LICENSE.md) license.

Pressbooks' webbooks and EPUB/[PDF](https://docraptor.com/blog/docraptor-vs-princexml/) exports are all driven by HTML + CSS. XML outputs have no styling.

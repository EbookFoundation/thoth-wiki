[BASE (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine)](https://www.base-search.net/) is a meta search / discovery engine hosted by Bielefeld University Library, Germany. BASE provides access to OA content from 8,600 content providers, among them ~15 e-book providers including COPIM partners Meson Press, OAPEN and DOAB.

### Technology

BASE is a registered [OAI provider](http://www.openarchives.org/service/listproviders.html), and offers a bespoke [OAI-PMH Validator (OVAL)](http://oval.base-search.net/) to ensure compatibility of potential content providers with its service.

BASE uses the `oai_dc` format and requires that request for ListRecords in returns results without a timeout or output error.
Documentation of the OAI interface is available at: http://oai.base-search.net/ which is accompanied by a concise [FAQ](https://www.base-search.net/about/en/faq_oai.php).

Next to OAI, BASE also provides a HTTP interface for easy integration with external services; this interface is accessible via https://api.base-search.net/ 

New / unlisted content providers can [apply to be added to BASE](https://www.base-search.net/about/en/suggest.php).

[Biblioteca Nacional de Espa√±a](http://www.bne.es/en/Inicio/) (BNE) is the National Library of Spain.

BNE has a dedicated programme - the [BNElab](https://bnelab.bne.es/en/data/) - to provide and further develop its Open Data approach for its collections.

### Formats

Currently, reuse of BNE's bibliographic catalogue and authority file data is made possible free of charge via XML and MARC formats; from its linked data portals in RDF format, and via the SPARQL access point; and from the Hispanic Digital Library using the OAI protocol for exchange and recollection.

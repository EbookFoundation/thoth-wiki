### Summary: 
Conifer is a web archiving service that creates an interactive copy of any web page that you browse, including content revealed by your interactions such as playing video and audio, scrolling, clicking buttons, and so forth.

### Format types: 
WARC, ARC, HAR

### Third-party content support: 
Recreates more of the user experience than other web archives (e.g. navigation, embedding).

### Features: 
Conifer is a user-driven platform. Users can create, curate, and share their own collections of web materials. This can even include items that would be only revealed after logging in or performing complicated actions on a web site. On the technical side, Conifer focuses on “high fidelity” web archiving. Items relying on complex scripting, such as embedded videos, fancy navigation, or 3D graphics have a much higher success rate for capture with Conifer than with traditional web archives.

### Costs: 
Free tier with 5GB of storage space with some networking quota restrictions. Access to collections that users made public is always free of charge and unlimited. $20 a month for 40GB of storage ($5 add on for an extra 20GB, or $200 a year).

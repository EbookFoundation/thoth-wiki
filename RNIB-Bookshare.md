### Ingest

#### Files

> We accept publisher book files in EPUB2, EPUB3, RTF and PDF. We can use your EPUB or RTF file to automatically make the title available in a range of accessible formats. Where your supply a PDF only, the book will only be available to download by our members as a PDF. 
Fixed format EPUB: we donâ€™t specifically block the fixed format / enhanced titles. But they do provide a poor automated conversion into other formats.
Text recognisable PDF: your PDFs must be text recognisable and not saved as images only. Please also ensure that crop marks are removed.

#### Metadata

> We accept metadata in ONIX 2.0 as a .xml file. We use a subset of a valid ONIX file based on the standards defined by EDItEUR.  If the ONIX meets those standards, we should be able to process it. Download the ONIX standards.
If sending multiple ONIX files, please ensure they have unique file names. The system will reject files with the same name and only process the last one in.

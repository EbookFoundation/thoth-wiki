BISG defines a publisher as the "entity that owns the legal right to make the given product available in this
form" (BISG, _Revised Best Practices for Book Metadata_, 156). While it is unclear if this definition works for many open access books, the publisher might better be considered the corporate entity charged with selecting, developing, and preparing a book for publication. Every [[book|Thoth_Works]] record must include the name of the publisher or legal entity responsible for bringing it to market, as well as the [[imprint|Thoth_Imprints]].

The **Publishers** page will display the Publishers the user has access to, usually only one. The following information is displayed:

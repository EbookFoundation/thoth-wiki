Orion Search collects academic publications from Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG). MAG is a heterogeneous graph containing scientific publication records, citation relationships between those publications, as well as authors, institutions, journals, conferences, and fields of study. It contains more than 235M documents covering every academic discipline. Orion Search enriches MAG with metadata from other sources; geocoding institutional affiliations and inferring authorsâ€™ gender with Google Places API and GenderAPI respectively. `source:` [Orion Search FAQ](https://www.orion-search.org/about/faq)

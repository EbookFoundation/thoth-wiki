[OpenAIRE Research Graph](https://beta.explore.openaire.eu/) 

> aggregates around 450Mi metadata records with links collecting from 10,000 data sources trusted by scientists! After cleaning, deduplication, and fine-grained classification processes, they narrow down to ~100Mi publications, ~8Mi datasets, ~200K software research products, 8Mi other products linked together with semantic relations.

> More than 10Mi full-texts of Open Access publications are mined by algorithms to enrich metadata records with additional properties and links among research products, funders, projects, communities, and organizations. Thanks to the mining algorithm, the graph is completed with 480Mi semantic relations.

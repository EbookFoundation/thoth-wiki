The **Diamond Discovery Hub** will be one of the main expected results of the CRAFT-OA project, comprising a service to boost the visibility, discoverability and recognition of the European network of Diamond Open Access publishers and technology providers. 

It appears to build on the existing discovery services provided by OpenAIRE, particularly the [OpenAIRE Graph](https://graph.openaire.eu).

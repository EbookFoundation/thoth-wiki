A [Digital Object Identifier](https://www.doi.org/) (DOI) can be assigned to any digital object with any level granularity. DOIs usually resolve to specific URLs.

> A DOI name is a specific instance of a persistent Handle name, which is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). More technically, a DOI is a persistent identifier in line with IETF RFC [3650](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3650.txt), [3651](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3651.txt), [3652](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3652.txt) (HANDLE system), ANSI/NISO Z39.84-2010, and [ISO 26234](https://www.iso.org/standard/43506.html). There is no limit length on a DOI name and it is case insensitive. ([Source](https://blog.libscie.org/doi-primer/))

In order to register a DOI, a publisher needs to be registered at one of the [registration agencies](https://www.doi.org/registration_agencies.html) that can issue DOIs. Most common in COPIM are [[CrossRef]], [[DataCite]], and [[EZID]].

[Scholia](https://scholia.toolforge.org/) is a service that creates visual scholarly profiles for topic, people, organizations, publishers, publications, etc. using bibliographic and other information in [[Wikidata]].

Scholia currently has only a limited reach, as it is reliant on [[Wikidata]], and Wikidata contains only a limited albeit growing subset of the corpus of scholarly literature, its authors and citations.

For an example, see [MIT Press on Scholia](https://scholia.toolforge.org/publisher/Q73820)

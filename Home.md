The following wiki lists all output formats, platforms, and other stakeholders that relate to the development of Thoth.

## Data Formats

Data formats are the formats in which the textual content of an [[object]] are commonly digitally encoded. The Thoth project is agnostic as to which data format is used.

* [[AZW3]]
* [[EPUB]]
* [[HTML]]
* [[JSON]]
* [[KFX]]
* [[MOBI]]
* [[PDF]]
* [[XML]]

## Metadata Formats

Metadata formats are the formats in which the [[metadata]] of an [[object]] are stored. Metadata formats have been developed both as part of software packages or as consortial standards. Different stakeholders in the [[scholcomm pipeline]] use different metadata format for different purposes. Moreover, different stakeholders maintain different subsets of the metadata potentially contained in specific formats. Thoth aims for a holistic approach, being able to export as many formats in as many flavors as possible.

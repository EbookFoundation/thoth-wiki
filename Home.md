The following wiki lists all output formats, platforms, and other stakeholders that relate to the development of [[open]] source metadata management system Thoth. Those wikis marked with an asterisk (*) are identified in the [WP5 Scoping Report](https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/wp5-scoping-report-building-open-dissemination-system/) and are indexed as an issue in the [Thoth Project](https://github.com/thoth-pub/thoth/projects).

The transfer protocols and file specifications listed in this wiki are those which have current or future support by Thoth. Any updates are welcome at wp5@copim.ac.uk.

# Data and Metadata Formats

## Data Formats

Data formats are the formats in which the textual content of an [[object]] are commonly digitally encoded. The Thoth project is agnostic as to which data format is used.

* [[AZW3]]
* [[EPUB]]
* [[HTML]]
* [[KFX]]
* [[MOBI]]
* [[PDF]]
* [[XML]]

## Metadata Formats

Metadata formats are the formats in which the [[metadata]] of an [[object]] are stored. Metadata formats have been developed both as part of software packages or as consortial standards. Different stakeholders in the [[scholcomm pipeline]] use different metadata format for different purposes. Moreover, different stakeholders maintain different subsets of the metadata potentially contained in specific formats. Thoth aims for a holistic approach, being able to export as many formats in as many flavors as possible.

# Content Platforms and Distributors

The following categorization in **Content Platforms and Distributors** and **Catalogs and Indices** has been adapted from Michael Clarke and Laura Ricci's draft report [*OA Books Supply Chain Mapping*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iCu5OlT1cFDyq6r6yBC6orgjoEMJthor/view).

## Ebook Distributors 

Ebook distributors differ from Digital Libraries in the sense that they do not claim to offer a scholarly function, be that to research institutions or to the general public. Distributors repackage and normalize ebook metadata. Most ebook distributors operate some form of monetization scheme, which may not be hospitable to OA books.

# Bibliographic Reference Management Platforms

All currently available bibliographic management platforms support import from [[BibTeX]] and [[RIS]]. Overall, these appear to be the two major formats. An excellent overview of every single platform is provided on the [OpenOffice wiki](https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Bibliographic/Software_and_Standards_Information).

# Publishing Platforms

Publishing platforms allow authors, editors, and publishers to collaborate in a digital, in-browser environment, with a potential to radically transform publishing production pipelines.

* [[Fulcrum]]
* [[Editoria]]

# Print Book Distributors

There are basically only two main print book distributors available to OA publishers who wish to use print-on-demand for their hardcopy publications, [[Amazon KDP]] and [[Ingram Lightning Source]]. Both require the manual input of metadata upload of print-ready PDF files without apparent batch or automated upload options. 

# OER

Open Educational Resources (OER) focus mainly on textbooks rather than scholarly publications.

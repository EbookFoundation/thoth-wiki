The following wiki lists all output formats, platforms, and other stakeholders that relate to the development of [[open]] source metadata management system Thoth. Those wikis marked with an asterisk (*) are identified in the [WP5 Scoping Report](https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/wp5-scoping-report-building-open-dissemination-system/) and are indexed as an issue in the [Thoth Project](https://github.com/thoth-pub/thoth/projects).

The transfer protocols and file specifications listed in this wiki are those which have current or future support by Thoth. Any updates are welcome at wp5@copim.ac.uk.

## Data Formats

Data formats are the formats in which the textual content of an [[object]] are commonly digitally encoded. The Thoth project is agnostic as to which data format is used.

* [[AZW3]]
* [[EPUB]]
* [[HTML]]
* [[JSON]]
* [[KFX]]
* [[MOBI]]
* [[PDF]]
* [[XML]]

## Metadata Formats

Metadata formats are the formats in which the [[metadata]] of an [[object]] are stored. Metadata formats have been developed both as part of software packages or as consortial standards. Different stakeholders in the [[scholcomm pipeline]] use different metadata format for different purposes. Moreover, different stakeholders maintain different subsets of the metadata potentially contained in specific formats. Thoth aims for a holistic approach, being able to export as many formats in as many flavors as possible.

### Digital Libraries

Digital libraries acquire and maintain collections of digital objects. The table below summarizes the available platforms, also providing information on their governance structure; membership fees; type of ingest; what they provide; whether they feature OA and/or non-OA content; and whether ingest happens via push (active upload by publisher) or through the exposition of the metadata of the object to a scraper.

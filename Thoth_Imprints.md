"The imprint name is the 'brand' name that the [[publisher|Thoth_Publishers]] uses as the public identity responsible for the product. Imprints usually appear on the title page and copyright page of the [[book|Thoth_Works]], or on the physical media of audio or digital products. Imprint names usually also appear on book spines and dust jackets, audio packages, and advertisements and other marketing material" (BISG, _Revised Best Practices for Book Metadata_, 156). For many publishers, the publisher and imprint are the same, in which case the name must be included in both a book's publisher and imprint metadata field.
